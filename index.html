Documentation and details on CITYTECH, Inc. Canary Framework are coming February 14, 2004. Check back then!

        Canary is a framework that enables simple monitoring of OSGi components and services. The Canary API provides a set of interfaces and annotations that quickly enable developers and engineers to peer into critical aspects of their system. Canary does this by collecting data from registered, monitored services and distributing that data to notification agents, poll response handlers, and persistence services. Canary also aims to reduce outage response and investigation by escalating log levels for problematic services and informing necessary parties of precisely where an investigation might begin. Lastly, Canary provides a clean, responsive UI for viewing collected data and other metrics, in addition to exposing data via JMX beans.
