##Introduction

The CITYTECH AEM Canary Framework
The CQ Component Plugin mitigates the effort required in Adobe CQ component development by generating, at built time, .content.xml, _cq_editConfig.xml, and dialog.xml files for your components, leaving you free to focus on functionality.

## Overview

Canary is a framework that enables simple monitoring of OSGi components and services. The Canary API provides a
set of interfaces and annotations that quickly enable developers and engineers to peer into critical aspects
of their system. Canary does this by collecting data from registered, monitored services and distributing that
data to notification agents, poll response handlers, and persistence services. Canary also aims to reduce outage
response and investigation by escalating log levels for problematic services and informing necessary parties of
precisely where an investigation might begin. Lastly, Canary provides a clean, responsive UI for viewing
collected data and other metrics, in addition to exposing data via JMX beans.
