# CQ Canary Framework

[CITYTECH, Inc.](http://www.citytechinc.com)

## Overview

Canary is a framework that enables simple monitoring of OSGi components and services. The Canary API provides a
set of interfaces and annotations that quickly enable developers and engineers to peer into critical aspects
of their system. Canary does this by collecting data from registered, monitored services and distributing that
data to notification agents, poll response handlers, and persistence services. Canary also provides a clean,
responsive UI for viewing collected data and other metrics, in addition to exposing data via JMX beans.
